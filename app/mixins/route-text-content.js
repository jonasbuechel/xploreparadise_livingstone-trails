          content: 'David Livingstone was born into poverty in 1813. He was one of seven children, and grew up in an environment of hard work and piety in Blantyre, Scotland. At age ten he was sent to work in the local cotton spinning factory to support his family. The foundations of his education were laid at the factory school, where he studied after his shift and at weekends. Early on he showed more curiosity towards science than the scholastic theology of traditional Scottish Calvinism his devout home was based on.'

          content: 'In 1834, Livingstone wanted to answer the appeal of the British and American churches searching for medical missionaries to China. But this dream was dashed when the First Opium War broke out in September 1839. Instead, he entered Glasgow University in 1836 to study theology and medicine. Four years later, after studying at various other institutes, he received his medical degree and was accepted by the London Missionary Society. After meeting with his future father-in-law, Robert Moffat, a Scottish missionary to southern Africa, Livingstone was convinced that Africa was the place to begin his missionary work.'

This, combined with his quest to highlight and fight against the horrors of the east African slave trade, made him of the most important and well-known explorers of Africa. The result is an impressive legacy still celebrated today.'

It is remarkably flat, but intersected in different parts by the beds of ancient rivers; and prodigious herds of certain antelopes, which require little or no water, roam over the trackless plains.”'

          content: 'With an area of over 1,000,000 square kilometres, the Kalahari extends from the northern region of South Africa to Namibia, Botswana, Angola and Zambia, straddling both sides of the Tropic of Capricorn. The Botswanan section of the Kalahari is mainly covered by grassland savannah and thick bush. In the northeast, the Kalahari Desert surrounds the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, the remains of ancient lake Makgadikgadi, now one of the largest salt flats in the world. Unlike most deserts, the Kalahari provides a habitat for a wide variety of mammals, predators, birds and reptiles. Only a handful of humans live in the remote parts of the inhospitable Kalahari Desert: these are the San people, also known as Basarwa. Unfortunately, due to forced displacement, very few of them can still live their traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle here.'
